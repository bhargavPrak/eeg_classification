# eeg_classification
 This is the code dump used in studying different datasets with the help of 4 different classification models:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Recurrent Neural network
 
 Since different datasets were used during the course of this study, this code only represents the definition of the models used, and need to be modified as per the dataset properties.
